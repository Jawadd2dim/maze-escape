## Description  
**Maze Escape** is a challenging top-down 2D maze game where you navigate through 5 perilous levels while avoiding relentless AI enemies. With no combat abilities, survival hinges on your speed, strategy, and cooperation with a mysterious friendly NPC. Built using **Godot 4**, this project demonstrates advanced AI systems, dynamic NPC interactions, and scalable difficulty.  

### Gameplay  
- **5 Increasingly Difficult Levels**: Mazes grow larger, and enemies become faster and deadlier.  
- **Enemy AI**:  
  - **Finite State Machine (FSM)**: Enemies switch between *Idle*, *Patrol*, *Chase*, and *Attack* states.  
  - **A* Pathfinding**: Enemies dynamically calculate optimal paths around obstacles to hunt the player.  
- **Friendly NPC**:  
  - **Memory System**: Remembers past interactions (e.g., "We meet again!").  
  - **Healing & Buffs**: Restores health or grants temporary speed boosts based on player needs.  
- **Save/Load System**: Save your progress, NPC dialogue history, and custom keybindings.  
- **Customizable Controls**: Rebind keys in the settings menu.  

### Technical Implementation  
- **Godot 4**: Utilizes `Navigation2D`, `AStar2D`, and signals for AI behavior.  
- **State Management**: Tracks NPC interactions using boolean flags and counters.

    *Grants a tutorial hint.
2.Subsequent Interactions:
    *Short greetings: "Hello again, wanderer."
    *Context-aware actions:
        *Heals player if health < 50%.
